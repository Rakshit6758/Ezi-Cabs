## ABSTRACT
Ride-Hailing is revolutionary transportation in cities. A central task in ride-hailing is providing the reliable transportation to riders and attractive earning to drivers when neither group is under centralized control.
This is especially challenging given that weather, traffic, sporting events, and holidays frequently cause hard predict imbalances between riders and driverâ€™s willingness to participate in the market. We discuss approaches and mathematical models used to overcome this challenge and provide an overview of other exciting new research questions in transportation opened by the growth of ride sharing.
