## ABSTRACT
Ride-Hailing is revolutionary transportation in cities. A central task in ride-hailing is providing the reliable transportation to riders and attractive earning to drivers when neither group is under centralized control.
This is especially challenging given that weather, traffic, sporting events, and holidays frequently cause hard predict imbalances between riders and driver’s willingness to participate in the market. We discuss approaches and mathematical models used to overcome this challenge and provide an overview of other exciting new research questions in transportation opened by the growth of ride sharing.

## INTRODUCTION
<p>Concept of organized rental cab or ride-hailing was introduced to Indian consumer in 2004 when Meru cab service was launched in major metro cities of India and then almost after six years App based rental cab service was introduced in Indian market. Among various transportation mode, cab service gained popularity because of its advantage of door-to-door service and now because of technological advancement customers were able to book cabs at competitive price in just one click using their smart phones. These App based cab services were having tremendous potential for growth in densely populated countries like India where parking is major problem because of space crunch as well as public transports are over cowered during peak hours.</p>
<p>As customers have become more demanding it is a challenging job for rental cab industry to meet the customer’s expectations. Now a days not just the price but quality service also plays an important role in customer satisfaction. Now using a smart phone consumer can access, compare, evaluate, and purchase. App based services such as Ola or Uber Cabs offered solution by offering various services ranging from the economic to ultimate luxury. As per a current report in the financial express introduction of App based pre-paid taxi services like Uber and Ola taxi not only grabbed customers’ attention but also contributed to increasing employability by providing opportunity to drivers.</p>

<br>
Ride-hailing refers to an act when a customer orders a customized ride online usually via a smartphone application. As opposed to ridesharing, the driver generally does not make any stops between the starting point and destination. In addition, there is a third party that mediates the service between the driver and the passenger.
In ride-hailing, the drivers offer their services for a profit, and riders cannot split the cost with the driver. The payment is charged automatically, and the income is shared between the mediator and the driver.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
<p>For transportation planners, helping the isolated areas for the developmental mainstream remains a formidable task. But it must be done to boost the income, technology, and quality-of-life gaps for the developing countries.</p>
<p>Going to the point, so along with better road infrastructure, affordable transport services tailored to local needs are often an overlooked but vital component of the sustainable provision of rural and isolation areas. The Government of India’s rural transport programme (“Pradhan Mantri Gram Parivahan Yojana”), provides connectivity and employment opportunities in these isolation areas. Through the programme, the Indian Ministry of Rural Development is providing substantial grants to rural entrepreneurs to buy vehicles; the operators are selected through local self-help groups including women, Dalits and tribal belonging to families being below the poverty line (Dash, 2016).</p>
<p>So, to resolve the issue regarding proper conveyance for these areas we are trying to make to a Conveyance Finder Application using Flutter which will be available for both IOS and android devices to provide conveyance in these isolation areas. This will help to provide the source of income to local drivers nearby these areas and moreover help the people to find their conveyance.</p>
<br>

## OBJECTIVE
<b>To make a conveyance finder app using open-source mobile UI framework flutter with OOPS concepts.</b>
